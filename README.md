# CLRPG
A text-based adventure game written in Common Lisp

This is by far the largest project I have worked on so far in Common Lisp

## Installation

Download/clone this repo to your computer and run this in any Common Lisp REPL, though I have tested this in CLisp and it works there

## Usage

To run this program, you need ALL the files downloaded (except the README) and you need a Common Lisp REPL: I used CLisp to test this project, which can be found [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/clisp/)

In the REPL, type 
  
    $ (load "main.lisp")
  
Assuming that clhtml.lisp is in your Home directory


If your clhtml.lisp is NOT in your Home directory, type

    $ (load "/path/main.lisp")

"/path/" being where/what folder clhtml.lisp is stored in


## Bugs

Bugs have yet to be reported, though I think some of the functions are incomplete.
